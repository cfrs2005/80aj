title: About Ruoyu Sun
---

I am **Ruoyu Sun**, a designer and developer living in Hong Kong. I grew up in mainland China and graduated from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk) with a degree in Business (and two minors in Computer Science and Statistics). I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/insraq) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-sun/27/6b6/b8).

I learn most of my technical stuff by myself, starting from 2000, when I first learnt to program in Quick Basic. After that, I learnt Visual Basic when I got my first Windows computer. In 2004, I switched to Linux (Mandriva) and learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript - I am still writing decent amount of Javascript (or Coffeescript, to be specific) now, both client side and server side (Node.js). Then I started to use the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack. I still use PHP quite extensively, even though I never like the language.

I started to program in C and Java in University when I complete my computer science minor. Meanwhile, in Business school, I had to use SAS and VBA for business statistics and in statistics courses, open source R is used. I was a research assistant in Computer Science department during summer when I wrote lots of Matlab code for data mining. The good thing about university is that I have lots of spare time so that I can learn to program in languages I like: Python and Ruby. I also write C#, even though I am not a big fan. I experiment with functional programming language like Scala, Haskell, Lua, etc. The next language I plan to learn is Go.

During my not-so-long time of programming, I participated in lots of projects. Most notably, I was active in [XOOPS](http://xoops.org/) from 2006 to 2010 and I have written a [book]( http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021247.do) on it, which is published by Oâ€™Reilly. I co-founded several startups, [9th.be](http://9th.be/), [AtImpress](http://atimpress.com) and [17Startup](http://17startup.com/). I am no longer related to any of these projects.

I am not an active blogger - I write much more code than blogs. However, I do enjoy writing, and sharing the findings and thoughts on design and development. There is no comment function (the blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github) but you can usually discuss about it on Hackers News or simply drop me an email: _ruoysun AT gmail DOT com_
