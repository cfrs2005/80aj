//SecureCrt 老是习惯 ctrl+s 导致屏幕假死 //你只需要再按 ctrl+q 即可解决 /*\* 原由:CTRL-S and CTRL-Q are called flow-control characters. They represent an antiquated way of stopping and restarting the flow of output from one device to another (e.g., from the computer to your terminal) that was useful when the speed of such output was low. They are rather obsolete in these days of high-speed networks. In fact, under the latter conditions, CTRL-S and CTRL-Q are basically a nuisance. The only thing you really need to know about them is that if your screen output becomes “stuck,” then you may have hit CTRL-S by accident. Type CTRL-Q to restart the output; any keys you may have hit in between will then take effect. \*/ //Ci框架中 关于 结果集返回的问题 //如果是单条记录 return $query->row\_array (); //如果是多条记录 return $query->result\_array (); //Zendstudio 导入ssh(rsa)证书 //首选项->常规->网络链接->SSH2->常规->添加私钥 /*\* 左侧窗口 选择Remotesyste 新建 -> 填写服务器对应的描述->创建完成->链接 输入用户名 ->密码留空 ->提交 就可以直接连上去[起初我也很纳闷，空密码，想着应该是直接连过去 而不需要输入密码] \*/ //linux shell 判断脚本是否在运行 //grep -v grep 不计算当前grep线程 PID=\`ps aux | grep "脚本名字" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'\` if [ -z "$PID" ]; then echo "当前不存在生成进程， 可以执行"; else echo "脚本正在运行， 稍后在试"; exit; fi
